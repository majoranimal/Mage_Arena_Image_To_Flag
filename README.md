# Mage Arena Image To Flag
This script allows you to upload most images into Mage Arena to be used as flags.

# How to use
1. Download the file that corresponds to your operating system from the releases section
2. Run the script
3. Upload your image
4. Restart your game(?)

# How it works
1. The script loads the image provided by the user
2. It reduces the image size to 100x66 (The flag size in-game)
3. It dithers the image to reduce the colours to the 41 available in-game
4. It converts the image to HEX and overwrites the flags registry entry

# Note
Please use common sense when uploading flags, if the flags are being abused the game devs could remove them.
