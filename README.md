# Mage Arena Image To Flag
This is a simple script that takes in an image, converts it to the correct colours and size for the flags in Mage Arena, and finally writes the flag to the registry so it can be loaded in game.
Please use your common sense to decide whether or not to use a flag, if the flags are abused they'll likely be removed.
